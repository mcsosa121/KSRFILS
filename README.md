Kyrlov Subspace Recycling for Fast Iterative Least Squares in Machine Learning using Data Sparse Matrix Computations

# What it is
This is a course project for CS 6220: Data Sparse Matrix Computations. We plan to implement the algorithms featured in the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00241.pdf) and apply them to real world and generated sparse datasets.
